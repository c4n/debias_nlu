{"id": "Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "text": "Hispanic Americans and Latino Americans -LRB- hispanos -LSB- is\u02c8panos -RSB- -RRB- are American descendants from Spain and the Spanish speaking countries of Latin America . More generally , it includes all persons in the United States who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino , whether of full or partial ancestry . For the 2010 United States Census , people counted as `` Hispanic '' or `` Latino '' were those who identified as one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the census questionnaire -LRB- `` Mexican , '' `` Puerto Rican , '' or `` Cuban '' -RRB- as well as those who indicated that they were `` other Spanish , Hispanic , or Latino . '' The national origins classified as Hispanic or Latino by the United States Census Bureau are the following : Spanish , Argentine , Cuban , Colombian , Puerto Rican , Mexican , Dominican , Costa Rican , Guatemalan , Honduran , Nicaraguan , Panamanian , Salvadoran , Bolivian , Chilean , Ecuadorian , Paraguayan , Peruvian , Uruguayan , and Venezuelan . Other U.S. government agencies have slightly different definitions of the term , including Portuguese and Brazilians . The Census Bureau uses the terms Hispanic and Latino interchangeably .   `` Origin '' can be viewed as the ancestry , nationality group , lineage , or country of birth of the person or the person 's parents or ancestors before their arrival in the United States . People who identify as Spanish , Hispanic , or Latino may be of any race . As the only specifically designated category of ethnicity in the United States -LRB- other than non-Hispanic/Latino -RRB- , Hispanics form a pan-ethnicity incorporating a diversity of inter-related cultural and linguistic heritages . Most Hispanic Americans are of Mexican , Puerto Rican , Cuban , Salvadoran , Dominican , Guatemalan , or Colombian origin . The predominant origin of regional Hispanic populations varies widely in different locations across the country .   Hispanic Americans are the second fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States after Asian Americans . Hispanic/Latinos overall are the second-largest ethnic group in the United States , after non-Hispanic Whites -LRB- a group which , like Hispanics and Latinos , is composed of dozens of sub-groups of differing national origin -RRB- .   Hispanics have lived within what is now the United States continuously since the founding of St. Augustine by the Spanish in 1565 . After Native Americans , Hispanics are the oldest ethnic group to inhabit much of what is today the United States . Many have Native American ancestry . Spain colonized large areas of what is today the American Southwest and West Coast , as well as Florida . Its holdings included present-day California , New Mexico , Nevada , Arizona , and Texas , all of which were part of the Republic of Mexico from its independence in 1821 until the end of the Mexican -- American War in 1848 .
